// Modules keep Angular apps modularized. There are usually
// one main module and other separate modules for common code,
// such as custom services. With large apps, we could even
// divide up modules based on functionality. For this APM app,
// we could have a module for pricing options or one for tracking
// vendors.
// Each controller and service must be registered with a module.

module app {
    angular.module("productManagement", []);
